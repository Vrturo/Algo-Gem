// Given a maze, NxN matrix. A rat has to find a path from source to des­ti­na­tion.
// maze[0][0] (left top corner)is the source and maze[N-1][N-1](right bot­tom cor­ner) is des­ti­na­tion.
// There are few cells which are blocked, means rat can­not enter into those cells.
// Rat can move in any direc­tion ( left, right, up and down).

// Input: A 2D-matrix with 0’s and 1’s fill in it.
// 0 means that cell is blocked and 1 means rat can move to that cell.

// Output: Print solution matrix
