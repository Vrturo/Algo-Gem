// The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares.
// The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.

// The rules of the game are simple:
// each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares.
// Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

// The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column,
// or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square,
// must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.
