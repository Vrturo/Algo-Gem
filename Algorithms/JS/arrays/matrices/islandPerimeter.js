// Island Perimeter
// You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
// Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water,
// and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
// The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island).
// One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100.
// Determine the perimeter of the island.

// Example:

// [[0,1,0,0],
//  [1,1,1,0],
//  [0,1,0,0],
//  [1,1,0,0]]

// Answer: 16
