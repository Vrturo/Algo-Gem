// Given a Pattern and a dictionary, print out all the strings that match the pattern.
// where a character in the pattern is mapped uniquely to a character in the dictionary.

// e.g 1. ("abc" , <"cdf", "too", "hgfdt" ,"paa">) -> output = "cdf"
//       2. ("acc" , <"cdf", "too", "hgfdt" ,"paa">) -> output = "too", "paa"
