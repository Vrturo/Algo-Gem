# Write a method to test whether a given input is a valid email address.
# Here is what makes a valid email:

# At least one letter character at the beginning
# All characters between the first character and the @ (if any) must be letters, numbers, or underscores
# There must be an @ character (after the points listed just now)
# After the @ character, there must be at least one word character (letter, number, or underscore) or hyphen
# The email must end with at least one set of a dot followed by one or more word characters.
# The input must NOT be case-sensitive
# The function should return true or false.
