# Count the number of Duplicates

# Write a method that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters
# that occur more than once in the given string.
# The given string can be assumed to contain only uppercase and lowercase alphabets.

# Example

# "abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
# "aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
# "aabbcdeB" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
# "indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i'
# "Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' and 's'
