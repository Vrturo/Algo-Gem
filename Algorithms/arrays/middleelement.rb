# Create a method that when provided with a triplet,
# returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.
# The input to the method will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

# For example:

# gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0
# 2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.

# gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1
# 10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is 1.
