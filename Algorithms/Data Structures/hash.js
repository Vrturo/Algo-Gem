// Hash

// Hashing is designed to solve the problem of needing to efficiently find or store an item in a collection.

// If we have a list of 10,000 words of English and we want to check if a given word is in the list,
// it would be inefficient to successively compare the word with all 10,000 items until we find a match.
// Hashing is a technique to make things more efficient by effectively narrowing down the search at the outset.

// What is hashing?

// Hashing means using some function or algorithm to map object data to some representative integer value.
// This so-called hash code (or simply hash) can then be used as a way to narrow down our search when looking
// for the item in the map.
