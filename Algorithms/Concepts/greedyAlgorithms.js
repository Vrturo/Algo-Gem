// Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece,
// always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
// Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems.
// An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property:
// At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment,
// and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.
// If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem,
// then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms
// are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming.
// But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied.
